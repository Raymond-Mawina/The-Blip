### A little tool idea that I've been putting off forever. I hoping this will help me with organizing different tasks I get busy with throughout my time as a swe. 
<br>

#### Disclaimer
I am software developer with roughly 2 years of work experience, so I am going to fail a lot when building this tool, but I hope to learn a lot of skills while working on this. I am not good at technical writing as I've never written a professional technical document before, so I am going read a book or two about technical writing during the span of this project, hopefully I will become better.

My goal is to always be better than I was yesterday, learning through falling and getting back up. I want this project to show that even though I am perfect or whatever, I am diligent, dedicated and have the curiosity of knowing different thing and trying them out.

#### A little Intro
Whenever I start working on a new project, I get the urge to spring right into writing the code and never seem to care about mapping out the project idea and making sure it is atleast partially/fully flashed out. This is a habit that has followed me in my young career as software developer. Usually what happens is that life happens and I get busy with something else more urgent and somehow forget what I wanted to build and need that project was going to solve/fuilfill.

I aim to change that with this project. I am not going to use motivation or excitement as a reason why I am building this tool, but rather I want to build something that will be used by me for me. This project for the most part is reinventing the wheel because there are such tools out there, but I still feel it is important to atleast try to build it and see how it turns out and see if this tool can be something I heavily rely on to organize my work and programming tasks. 


#### Outlining what I want to build...
I want to use the concept of user stories to flash out what this tool will do. I find that when a product is built from the perspective of the user it is usually friendly to that most of the other users. I am building this tool for Raymond Mawina, so I need to understand what he needs this tool for/todo. 

Here is an article on user stories: [user stories](https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/agile/user-stories)

##### My user story epics and underlying user stories for this tool:

- [ ] **Epic: The site user can sign up, sign in and sign out.** 
   - [ ] 1. As a site user I want to be able to create an account/sign up.
   - [ ] 2. As a site user I want to sign in using my credentials.
   - [ ] 3. As a site user I want to be able to sign out when signed in, and redirected to the sign-in page. 

- [ ] **Epic: The site user can view their profile.** 
   - [ ] 1. As a site user I want to be able to add/change my personal github account.
   - [ ] 2. As a site user I want to be able to add/change my work github account.
   - [ ] 3. As a site user I want to be able to add/change my contact info(email,mobile).

- [ ] **Epic: The site user can view their task kanban/sprint board.** 
    - [ ] 1. As a site user I want to be able to view my task board, which will have the columns: backlog,in_progress,review, review_feedback, complete.
    - [ ] 2. As a site user I want to be able to scroll through each column in the event that there are too many items in that column.
    - [ ] 3. As a site user I want to be able to add tasks to the backlog column, task header, task description, task links(api links, github links, document links), task due date.
    - [ ] 4. As a site user I want to be able to move a task from backlog to in_progress column, in_progress to backlog, in_progress to review, in_progress to complete, complete to review_feedback, review_feedback to review.
    - [ ] 5. As a site user I want to be able to rewind time and see what tasks were on my board in the past based on the dates and times I provide.
    - [ ] 6. As a site user I want to be able to view some sort of performance dashboard to understand how productive I am compared to previous months.

- [ ] **Epic: The site user can view their board task in Isolation.** 
    - [ ] 1. As a site user I want to be able to view a single task in isolation.
    - [ ] 2. As a site user I want to be able to add/edit a tasks title, descriptions, and links in the isolated view and want to be able to save these changes.
    - [ ] 3. As a site user I want to be able to delete the task through pressing a button, which will bring up a pop-up asking if I am sure I want to perform the destructive action.
    - [ ] 4. As a site user I want to be able to categorize tasks based on whose task it is (work or personal). priority(1 or 2 or 3) where 1 is the most prioritized, and I want the post recently and highly prioritized tasks to appear at the top of their respective columns.
